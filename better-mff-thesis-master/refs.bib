abstract = {A new microclimate data logger (TMS) resembling a small plant is presented.•It accurately measures soil moisture and soil, surface and air temperature.•Large memory and long battery life allow >10 years of independent operation.•The TMS logger provides microclimate measurements at a biologically relevant scale.
Climate measurements are needed at a scale at which organisms live and die. Currently available climate sensors, however, are not well suited for long-term field measurements at such a scale. We have therefore developed a new temperature and moisture logger, the Temperature-Moisture-Sensor (TMS), which we designed for a wide range of ecological applications. The device mimics a small herbaceous plant. Its belowground part houses a patented, proprietary soil moisture sensor working on the time-domain transmission principle. Air, surface and soil temperatures are measured simultaneously by three independent sensors. The TMS data logger has a large memory and long battery life, so it is suitable for taking long-term microclimate measurements in the field. With a data acquisition interval of 15 min, it has sufficient memory to last for almost 15 years.
We have thoroughly tested the TMS logger both in the laboratory and in demanding field conditions ranging from tropical rain forests of Africa to high-elevation cold deserts of the Himalayas. The device has provided microclimate measurements in a wide range of environmental conditions and has also performed well in controlled laboratory settings.
The key added value of the TMS logger is that it concurrently measures soil moisture as well as soil, surface and air temperature at a biologically relevant scale. It is also able to continuously measure the microclimate for several years even in the most extreme conditions. The device can therefore be used to build extensive tailored field measurement networks providing crucial data about microclimate conditions shaping biological processes in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {The ability of a forest to buffer understory temperature extremes depends on the canopy structure, which is often measured from the ground. However, ground measurements provide only point estimates, which cannot be used for spatially explicit microclimate modeling. Canopy structures derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can overcome these limitations, but high point-density LiDAR is expensive and computationally challenging. Therefore, we explored whether unmanned aerial systems (UAS) processed with the structure-from-motion (SfM) algorithm could serve as an alternative source of canopy variables for forest microclimate modeling. Specifically, we compared the performance of the canopy cover and height derived from the ground measurements and passive (UAS-SfM) and active (UAS-LiDAR) remote sensing as predictors of air and soil temperature offsets (i.e. differences between the forest understory and treeless areas).
We found that the maximum air temperatures were substantially lower inside than outside the forest, with differences ranging from 9.0 to 12.5 °C. The soil temperatures under the canopy were also reduced, but the soil temperature offsets were lower and ranged from 1.1 to 2.8 °C. The air and soil temperature offsets both increased with increasing tree height and canopy cover. However, the prediction ability of tree height and canopy cover differed if they were ground-based or remotely sensed. The remotely sensed canopy indices explained air temperature offsets better (UAS-SfM: R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 0.75 °C; UAS-LiDAR: R2 = 0.57, RMSE = 0.76 °C) than ground measurements (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 0.80 °C). Ground-based metrics explained soil temperature offsets better (R2 = 0.37, RMSE = 0.36 °C) than passive remote sensing approach (UAS-SfM: R2 = 0.27, RMSE = 0.39 °C), but comparably to active one (UAS-LiDAR: R2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.37 °C).
Our results suggest that both UAS-SfM and UAS-LiDAR can substitute ground canopy measurements for air temperature modeling, but soil temperature modeling is more challenging. Overall, our results show that forest microclimate can be modelled at a very high spatial resolution using UAS equipped with inexpensive optical cameras. The increasingly available UAS-SfM approach can thus provide fine-resolution microclimatic data much needed for biologically relevant predictions of species responses to climate change.
•Forest temperature buffering increases with increasing canopy cover and tree height.•UAS remote sensing explains air temperature buffering better than ground measurements.•UAS-SfM predicts air temperature buffering as well as UAS-LiDAR.},

abstract = {Aim: Forest understorey microclimates are often buffered against extreme heat or cold, with important implications for the organisms living in these environments. We quantified seasonal effects of understorey microclimate predictors describing canopy structure, canopy composition and topography (i.e., local factors) and the forest patch size and distance to the coast (i.e., landscape factors). Location: Temperate forests in Europe. Time period: 2017–2018. Major taxa studied: Woody plants. Methods: We combined data from a microclimate sensor network with weather-station records to calculate the difference, or offset, between temperatures measured inside and outside forests. We used regression analysis to study the effects of local and landscape factors on the seasonal offset of minimum, mean and maximum temperatures. Results: The maximum temperature during the summer was on average cooler by 2.1 °C inside than outside forests, and the minimum temperatures during the winter and spring were 0.4 and 0.9 °C warmer. The local canopy cover was a strong nonlinear driver of the maximum temperature offset during summer, and we found increased cooling beneath tree species that cast the deepest shade. Seasonal offsets of minimum temperature were mainly regulated by landscape and topographic features, such as the distance to the coast and topographic position. Main conclusions: Forest organisms experience less severe temperature extremes than suggested by currently available macroclimate data; therefore, climate–species relationships and the responses of species to anthropogenic global warming cannot be modelled accurately in forests using macroclimate data alone. Changes in canopy cover and composition will strongly modulate the warming of maximum temperatures in forest understories, with important implications for understanding the responses of forest biodiversity and functioning to the combined threats of land-use change and climate change. Our predictive models are generally applicable across lowland temperate deciduous forests, providing ecologically important microclimate data for forest understories.},

abstract = {Abstract Many organisms live in environments in which temperatures differ substantially from those measured by standard weather stations. The last decade has witnessed a paradigm shift in efforts to quantify these differences and to understand their ecological, functional and evolutionary implications. This renewed interest in microclimate ecology has been accompanied by the development of various compact temperature sensors and radiation shields. However, it is clear that there are many pitfalls when measuring temperature using these devices. Here we address the problem of measuring temperatures in these microenvironments accurately. We first discuss the theory of measuring surface, ground and air temperatures with reference to energy fluxes and how these are modified by material, reflective properties and size of the device. We highlight the particular difficulties associated with measuring air temperature. We then report on the results of a series of experiments in which air temperatures recorded by various commonly used microclimate temperature loggers are compared to those obtained using research-grade instruments and synoptic weather stations. While accurate measurements of surface and ground temperatures and air temperatures at night and in shaded environments can be relatively easily obtained, we show substantial errors are to be expected when measuring air temperatures in environments exposed to sunlight. Most standard sensors yield large errors, which can reach 25°C due to radiative fluxes operating on the thermometer. This problem cannot be wholly overcome by shielding the thermometer from sunlight, as the shield itself will influence both the temperatures being measured and the accuracy of measurement. We demonstrate that reasonably accurate estimates of air temperature can be obtained with low-cost and unshielded ultrafine-wire thermocouples that possess low thermal emissivity and a highly reflective surface. As the processes that create microclimatic temperature variation are the same as those that cause errors, other logger types should be used with care, and generally avoided in environments exposed to sunlight and close to the ground where wind speeds are lower. We urge researchers interested in microclimates and their effects to pay greater heed to the physics of heat exchange when attempting to measure microclimate temperatures and to understand the trade-offs that exist in doing so.},

•We modelled near-ground temperatures at 25 m resolution across managed boreal forests.•The effects of climate-forcing factors differed between months over the snow-free period.•Vegetation dominates over physiography as microclimatic driver during the warm season.•Forest management has a key role in modifying the local impact of global warming.
The majority of microclimate studies have been done in topographically complex landscapes to quantify and predict how near-ground temperatures vary as a function of terrain properties. However, in forests understory temperatures can be strongly influenced also by vegetation. We quantified the relative influence of vegetation features and physiography (topography and moisture-related variables) on understory temperatures in managed boreal forests in central Sweden. We used a multivariate regression approach to relate near-ground temperature of 203 loggers over the snow-free seasons in an area of ∼16,000 km2 to remotely sensed and on-site measured variables of forest structure and physiography. We produced climate grids of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures at 25 m resolution by using only remotely sensed and mapped predictors. The quality and predictions of the models containing only remotely sensed predictors (MAP models) were compared with the models containing also on-site measured predictors (OS models). Our data suggest that during the warm season, where landscape microclimate variability is largest, canopy cover and basal area were the most important microclimatic drivers for both minimum and maximum temperatures, while physiographic drivers (mainly elevation) dominated maximum temperatures during autumn and early winter. The MAP models were able to reproduce findings from the OS models but tended to underestimate high and overestimate low temperatures. Including important microclimatic drivers, particularly soil moisture, that are yet lacking in a mapped form should improve the microclimate maps. Because of the dynamic nature of managed forests, continuous updates of mapped forest structure parameters are needed to accurately predict temperatures. Our results suggest that forest management (e.g. stand size, structure and composition) and conservation may play a key role in amplifying or impeding the effects of climate-forcing factors on near-ground temperature and may locally modify the impact of global warming.},

abstract = {Ecological research heavily relies on coarse-gridded climate data based on standardized temperature measurements recorded at 2 m height in open landscapes. However, many organisms experience environmental conditions that differ substantially from those captured by these macroclimatic (i.e. free air) temperature grids. In forests, the tree canopy functions as a thermal insulator and buffers sub-canopy microclimatic conditions, thereby affecting biological and ecological processes. To improve the assessment of climatic conditions and climate-change-related impacts on forest-floor biodiversity and functioning, high-resolution temperature grids reflecting forest microclimates are thus urgently needed. Combining more than 1200 time series of in situ near-surface forest temperature with topographical, biological and macroclimatic variables in a machine learning model, we predicted the mean monthly offset between sub-canopy temperature at 15 cm above the surface and free-air temperature over the period 2000–2020 at a spatial resolution of 25 m across Europe. This offset was used to evaluate the difference between microclimate and macroclimate across space and seasons and finally enabled us to calculate mean annual and monthly temperatures for European forest understories. We found that sub-canopy air temperatures differ substantially from free-air temperatures, being on average 2.1°C (standard deviation ± 1.6°C) lower in summer and 2.0°C higher (±0.7°C) in winter across Europe. Additionally, our high-resolution maps expose considerable microclimatic variation within landscapes, not captured by the gridded macroclimatic products. The provided forest sub-canopy temperature maps will enable future research to model below-canopy biological processes and patterns, as well as species distributions more accurately.},

abstract = {Vegetation dynamics of three forest communities were studied by resampling of relevés recorded in the 1970s in the Bohemian Forest (Šumava Mountains). Results of multivariate analysis (RDA) confirmed significant time changes in species composition of the climax (
Calamagrostio-Piceetum) and waterlogged (
Bazzanio-Piceetum) spruce forests. The changes in the sphagnum-rich waterlogged spruce forests (
Sphagno-Piceetum) are close to the level of significance. The main vegetation changes are represented by a decrease in cover and/or frequency of hygrophilous or sciophilous species (e.g.
Athyrium distentifolium,
Oxalis acetosella) in climax spruce forests, and an abundant increase of species, indicating a preference to drier stands or better light conditions (e.g.
Calamagrostis villosa,
Vaccinium vitis-idaea or
Avenella flexuosa), in waterlogged spruce forests. We also found a higher proportion of meadow species (e.g.
Anthoxanthum odoratum,
Festuca rubra or
Luzula multiflora) in the newly recorded relevés from waterlogged forests. Analysis of species number per plot showed a remarkable shift to species-rich communities, especially in waterlogged stands.
We tried to find the possible factors responsible for the observed changes. Unfortunately, only indirect measurement of environmental factors using Ellenberg’s indicator values could be used and did not yield sufficient results. Thus, the changes observed in climax spruce forests were ascribed mainly to a decrease in canopy cover, which was directly estimated. In waterlogged forests, a complex of several general factors, which influence the climax spruce forest, had to be taken into account, such as: (i) a decrease in atmospheric acidification during the last 10–15 years and subsequent improvement in soil conditions, especially in waterlogged stands; (ii) fragmentation of forests as a result of bark-beetles attack; (iii) climate warming documented by long-term local meteorological measurements.},

Snow cover and seasonally frozen ground (SFG) are the key cryospheric elements on the southern edge of Altai Mountains (SEAM). Quantifying the thermal effect of snow cover on the frozen ground remains challenging. Utilizing the datasets observed at Altai Kuwei Snow Station (AKSS) and by National Meteorological Stations of China Meteorological Administration (CMA), we evaluated the thermal effect of snow cover on SFG regime. The results observed by AKSS indicated that the energy exchange between the ground and atmosphere was significantly insulated by snow cover, resulting in a considerable temperature offset between the snow surface and the ground below. This offset reached a maximum of 12.8°C for a snow depth of 50 cm, but decreased for snowpack depths of >70 cm, whereas the snow temperature lapse rate was systematically steeper in the upper snowpack than at depth. Snow cover was the dominating driver of inter-annual differences in the SFG regime, as represented by the annual maximum freezing depth and soil heat flux. The observed average soil heat loss rate increased from 2.68 to 5.86 W/m2 on two occasions when the average snow depth decreased from 61.2 cm to 13.7 cm, resulting in an increase in maximum freezing depth of SFG from 69 cm to >250 cm soil depth. The results observed by CMA also demonstrate how snow cover controlled the SFG regime by warming the ground and inhibiting freezing of the soil column. Snow cover caused a 44.5-cm decline of annual maximum freezing depth during 1961-2015 period. SFG degradation between 1961 and 2015 was accompanied by increases in both air temperature and snow cover, with the former playing the dominant role. The correlation between snow cover and the ground–atmosphere temperature offset provides a new empirical method of evaluating the effective thermal effect of snow cover on SFG.},

However, we know little about where, or in what roosts bats hibernate. Ussurian tube-nosed bats (Murina ussuriensis) have occasionally been observed under or near the surface of snow. We collected the details of those accounts and used our own observations to conclude that these bats hibernate in snow. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of hibernation in snow for bats, and second for mammals, following polar bears (Ursus maritimus) denning in snow.},

It will guide readers sequentially through the stages of properly designed sampling, exploratory data analysis, variography (computing the variogram and modelling it), followed by ordinary kriging and finally mapping kriged estimates and their errors. There will be short section on trend and universal kriging.  Other types of kriging will be mentioned so that readers can delve further in the substantive literature to tackle more complex tasks.},

Ve druhé části jsou prezentovány výsledky analýzy časových řad z klimatologických stanic. V práci byl použit Spearmanův korelační koeficient, pomocí kterého se měřila síla vztahu mezi sněhovými a klimatickými proměnnými a následně mezi sněhovými charakteristikami navzájem. Výsledky ukázaly, že nejdominantnějším faktorem, který ovlivňuje meziroční variabilitu sněhové pokrývky je teplota vzduchu. Méně jednotné výsledky vyšly při měření sílu vztahu mezi sněhovými charakteristikami navzájem. Mezi některými byla zjištěna velmi silná korelace, naopak mezi jinými byla korelace neprůkazná.

abstract = {Quantile-quantile plots, or qqplots, are an important visual tool for many applications but their interpretation requires some care and often more experience. This apparent subjectivity is unnecessary. By drawing on the computational and display facilities now widely available, qqplots are easily enriched to help with their interpretation. An overview of quantile functions and quantile-quantile plots is presented against the backdrop of their early historical development. Strengths and shortcomings of the traditional display are described. A new enhanced qqplot, the self-calibrating qqplot, is introduced and demonstrated on a variety of examples-both synthetic and real. Real examples include normal qqplots, log-normal plots, half-normal plots for factorial experiments, qqplots for
and s in process improvement applications, detection of multivariate outliers, and the comparison of empirical distributions. Self-calibration is had by visually incorporating sampling variation in the qqplot display in a variety of ways. The new qqplot is available through the function and R package qqtest.

abstract = {Forest microclimate plays an integral role in ecosystem processes, yet a predictive understanding of its spatial and temporal variability in heterogeneous landscapes is largely lacking. In this study, we used regression kriging (RK) to analyze the degree to which physiographic versus ecological variables influence spatio-temporal variation in understory microclimate conditions. We monitored understory temperature in 200 forest plots within a 274 km² environmentally heterogeneous region in northern California (0.55 obs/km²). For each plot location, we measured four physiographic influences (elevation, coastal proximity, potential solar radiation, topographic wetness index) and three ecological drivers (forest patch size, proximity to forest edge, tree abundance). Temperature observations were aggregated to three time scales (hourly, daily, and monthly) to examine temporal variability in microclimate dynamics and its effect on spatial prediction. The obtained prediction models included both physiographic and vegetative effects, although the relative importance of individual effects varied greatly between the different models. Across time scales, elevation and coastal proximity had the most consistent physiographic effects on temperature, followed by the vegetative effects of forest patch size and distance to forest edge. RK captured significantly more landscape-scale variability in understory temperature than a regression-only approach with considerably better model performance at hourly and daily time scales than at a monthly scale. Using varied sampling density scenarios our results also suggest that predictive accuracy drops considerably at densities less than 0.34 obs/km². This research illustrates how geospatial and statistical modeling can be used to distinguish physiographic versus ecological effects on microclimate dynamics and elucidates the spatial and temporal scales that these processes operate.},

abstract = {Forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests. To fully understand and better predict how forests' biodiversity and functions relate to climate and climate change, microclimates need to be integrated into ecological research. Despite the potentially broad impact of microclimates on the response of forest ecosystems to global change, our understanding of how microclimates within and below tree canopies modulate biotic responses to global change at the species, community and ecosystem level is still limited. Here, we review how spatial and temporal variation in forest microclimates result from an interplay of forest features, local water balance, topography and landscape composition. We first stress and exemplify the importance of considering forest microclimates to understand variation in biodiversity and ecosystem functions across forest landscapes. Next, we explain how macroclimate warming (of the free atmosphere) can affect microclimates, and vice versa, via interactions with land‐use changes across different biomes. Finally, we perform a priority ranking of future research avenues at the interface of microclimate ecology and global change biology, with a specific focus on three key themes: (1) disentangling the abiotic and biotic drivers and feedbacks of forest microclimates; (2) global and regional mapping and predictions of forest microclimates; and (3) the impacts of microclimate on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the face of climate change. The availability of microclimatic data will significantly increase in the coming decades, characterizing climate variability at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales relevant to biological processes in forests. This will revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics, drivers and implications of forest microclimates on biodiversity and ecological functions, and the impacts of global changes. In order to support the sustainable use of forests and to secure their biodiversity and ecosystem services for future generations, microclimates cannot be ignored.
Below‐canopy forest microclimates contrast strongly with the climate outside forests due to the presence of trees and shrubs. Here we review the drivers and the importance of forest microclimates in the face of climate change, and perform a priority ranking of future research avenues.},

volume = {63},
year = {1993},
abstract = {Clearcut, remnant old-growth forest patch, and edge are the three primary landscape elements in northwestern North America. Microclimatic information on this forest landscape is needed for both research and resources management purposes. In this paper, seasonal summaries and diurnal changes in air temperature and moisture, soil temperature and moisture, short-wave radiation, and wind velocity are quantified for recent clearcut (10–15 years old), edge, and adjacent interior old-growth Douglas-fir forest environments in southern Washington state, USA, over two growing seasons. Influences of local weather condition and edge orientation (relationship of edge to the azimuth) are also assessed. Over the growing season, daily averages of air and soil temperatures, wind velocity, and short-wave radiation are consistently lower, and soil and air moisture are higher, inside the forest than in the clearcut or at the edge. Daily differences (i.e. maximums minus minimums) of all variables are consistently lower in the forest. The microclimates at the edge and the clearcut show a variable relationship with regard to averages and differences. Between the edge and the forest, greater differences occur under clear sky conditions for air temperature, but under partial cloudy conditions for relative humidity and soil temperature. Edge orientation is critical in assessing solar radiation, soil moisture, and relative humidity. The highest variability in microclimate exists at the edge, rather than in either clearcut or interior forest, primarily because of the influences related to edge orientation. The supposition that edge microclimates are intermediate between clearcut and interior forest is consistently true only for wind velocity and solar radiation, not for temperature and moisture.},

abstract = {During winter, monarch butterflies form dense colonies in oyamel fir forests on high mountains in central Mexico, where the forest canopy serves both as a blanket, moderating temperature, and an umbrella, shielding the butterflies from rain. In this study we investigated the vertical dimension of the butterflies' use of the oyamel forest: we predicted that clusters form at the heights above ground that provide the greatest protection from freezing. By suspending temperature recorders at eight heights, from ground level up to 22m, we established two vertical transects in the forest. We set one transect in a densely forested area and the other in a thinned area, and we recorded hourly temperatures from Jan 13 through Feb 5, 2006. Intermediate heights in the forest, from 10 to 15m above ground, remained the warmest during the cold night and early morning. We also determined that this temperature distribution matched available records of the vertical distribution of butterflies roosting in branch and trunk clusters. The vertical temperature profiles became uniform during mid-day. Temperature extremes were moderated more during clear than during cloudy periods and more in the denser than in the thinned forest. Our results illustrate how the monarch butterfly is behaviorally adapted to the three-dimensional complexity of microclimate in the oyamel forest. A denser forest provides better protection for the overwintering survival of monarch butterflies than a thinned forest. This research bolsters our other microclimatic studies, all of which point to the urgency of prohibiting logging within the oyamel forest used as wintering habitat by monarch butterflies.},
